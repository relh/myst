from a balcony looking down
from a high vantage point
from the ground looking up
through a window
from a foyer looking up
from an elevated walkway
viewed from the second-floor
from a rooftop looking down
looking in
looking out
from the edge of a cliff looking over
from the end of a pier looking back towards shore
from beneath a canopy looking outwards
from the top of a staircase looking down
from a bridge spanning a river
from a tunnel exit looking out
from the base of a monument looking upwards
from a hilltop surveying the landscape below
from inside a cave entrance gazing out
from a valley looking upwards at surrounding peaks
from a high archway
from the corner of a large room
from a narrow alleyway looking towards the street
from a revolving door at the entrance
from the foot of a grandiose staircase
from a window seat looking outward
from a landing between flights of stairs
from a balcony overlooking the interior
from a skylight above
from the end of a long hallway
